/** Classwork 14 TODO:

1. Write a loop to find the minimum sqaure value of this following array and print the value
   double arr[8] = {-5, 9.5, 2, -1.34, 6, -7, 0.54, -4};

2. Swap the first two values -5 and 9.5, and then print the array one value per line
   using a loop.

3. Write a function to take 3 ints and return the sum of their squared values
   and call it in main() using 13, 16, 40. Make sure to write prototypes.

4. Write another function to take an array of 3 doubles, and another empty array of 2 doubles
   update the second array such that result[0] is the circumference and result[1] is the area
   if the 3 doubles cannot form a triangle, return circumference and area as 0
   Call it in main using arr[] = 13, 16, 15. Make sure to write prototypes.

5. Upload your scratch work (a picture file) on trace_HW3.c
